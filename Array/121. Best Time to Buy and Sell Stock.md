### Question:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

方法1：
- Kadane's algorithm, 本质是节省空间的DP算法
```cpp
  public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxCur = 0, maxSoFar = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            maxCur = Math.max(0, maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxCur, maxSoFar);
        }
        return maxSoFar;
    }
```
